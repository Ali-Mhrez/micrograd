# Tiny Autograd Engine

This project implements a tiny scalar-valued autograd engine, following Andrej Karpathy's excellent [lecture](https://www.youtube.com/@AndrejKarpathy) on backpropagation.  It also includes a small PyTorch-like neural network library built on top of the autograd engine. This repository is a direct copy of the code from the original [source](https://github.com/karpathy/micrograd/blob/master).
